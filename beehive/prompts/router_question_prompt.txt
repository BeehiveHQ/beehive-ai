Here is a clarification question that came in from a language-model powered agent: <question>{{question}}</question>

Who is best poised to answer this question? Choose from the following agents: {{agents}}. Here are the agent descriptions:
<agent_descriptions>
{{agent_descriptions}}
</agent_descriptions>

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"invokable": {"default": "Invokable to answer question.", "title": "Invokable", "type": "string"}}}
```
